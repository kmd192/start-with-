        What Does Web Mean?
        The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, 
        a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser. 
        Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms 
        interchangeably. However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of servers 
        that makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible. So, although the Web 
        does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not one and same.

        Techopedia Explains Web
        Web pages are formatted in a language called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). It this 
        language that allows users to click through pages on the Web via links. The Web uses HTTP 
        protocol to transmit data and share information. Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google 
        Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are used to access Web documents, or Web pages, which are connected
        via links.

        The Web is just one of the ways that information is shared over the Internet; 
        others include email, instant messaging and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
